## Description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design, with a focus on object-oriented design. Software design can easily be discounted as a secondary concern when solving small computing problems such as assignments and scripts. However, it assumes a critical role when attempting to build realistic and high-quality software applications. The course 
combines rigorous foundations (guiding principles, precise terminology, well-defined techniques) with extensive opportunities for the development of practical skills using state-of-the art tools and technique based on the latest research and practice in software engineering. 

### Sample Course Topics
* General Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutablity, interface segregation, etc.);
* Design patterns and design smells;
* Design techniques such as Design by Contract and Refactoring;
* Effective use of programming language mechanisms (exception handling, serialization, concurrency and synchronization, reflection, etc.);
* Software development tools such as automatic testing tools, coverage analyzers, static checkers. 

### Prerequisites
The official prerequisites are COMP 206 and COMP 250. However, this course targets students who have reached at least a working level of Java programming fluency. In practice, it is very difficult to learn software design when still getting familiar with basic programming idioms. This means that students registering to take COMP 303 should be able to, with a minimum of hesitation, write Java programs to solve small and well-defined problems, use a revision control system to organize their work, and use a debugger to trace through execution and inspect run-time values. This requirement cannot be nearly captured by any specific combination of courses, but students who feel they could use additional programming experience are encouraged to take COMP 302 before or during the term in which they take COMP 303.

### Learning Outcomes
After this course, you should be able to... 

* *Name, using the proper terminology:* The important first principles, techniques, and tools of object-oriented software design;
* *Describe and explain:* The important principles, techniques, and tools of object-oriented software design;
* *Apply:* The important principles, techniques, and tools of object-oriented software design to provide effective solutions to realistic design problems;
* *Evaluate:* The quality of design solutions
* *Write:* well-designed, error-free, and easily understandable software.
