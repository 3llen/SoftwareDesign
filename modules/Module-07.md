## Module 7 - Inheritance

## Description

*Inheritance* is a programming language-supported mechanism that allows us to assemble state and computation from different classes into a single object. It is a powerful feature that offers a natural solution to many design problems related to code extensibility and dynamic configuration. At the same time, it is a complex mechanism that can all too easily be misused. In this module, I will offer a review of inheritance and present the major design rules and patterns involving it.

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

* Have a deep understanding of the motivation for and conceptual foundations of inheritance;
* Be able to create class hierarchies that involve inheritance;
* Know about common problems with inheritance and how to avoid them;
* Be able to use the Template Method Design Pattern effectively;

## Reading

* Textbook Chapter 6;
