## Module 6 - Inversion of Control

## Description

The idea of inversion of control is one of the most powerful intellectual tools in a software designer tool-box. It allows us to build incredibly sophisticated applications while keeping the overall design complexity down to a manageable level. The Observer pattern is extremely common in software development, and it's realized by most GUI toolkits on most software development platforms, from desktop to web to mobile applications. This module is dedicated to the principle of inversion of control (IoC) and its realization in the Observer pattern, also called the Model-View Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

* Be able to use the Observer design pattern effectively;
* Be able to design and implement simple graphical user interfaces with Swing and JavaFX;
* Understand the concept of an application framework;

## Notes


## Reading

* Textbook 5.3, 8.1, 8.4;
* The [JavaFX Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/hello_world.htm)
* Solitaire v0.3 The [DeckView](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire/blob/v0.3/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/solitaire/gui/DeckView.java) class as an example of a GUI observer.

## Exercises

Exercises prefixed with **(+)** are optional, more challenging questions aimed to provide you with additional design and programming experience. Exercises prefixed with **(P)** (for "project") will incrementally guide you towards the ultimate completion of a complete Solitaire application.
