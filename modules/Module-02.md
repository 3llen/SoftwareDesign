# Module 2 - Types and Polymorphism

## Description

One of the main mechanisms at our disposal for designing object-oriented applications is *polymorphism*, which in the case of Java and similar languages is heavily tied to the notion of a type system. In this module I will do a brief review of the foundations of polymorphism, introduce the idea of interface programming, and present common low-level design problems that are easily solved with polymorphism.

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

* Be able to explain the concept of subtype polymorphism in object-oriented programming;
* Understand and be able to use the Interface Segregation Principle;
* Be able to create and interpret UML Class Diagrams;
* Know the difference between an interface type and a class's interface;
* Be able to implement existing interfaces to provide required functionality;
* Understand the ideas of anonymous classes and function objects and be able to use them effectively;
* Know about the concept of Design Patterns;
* Be able to effectively use the *Iterator* and *Strategy* design patterns;
* Know and be able to effectively use some of the common Java utility interfaces, including `Comparable` and `Comparator`.

## Notes


## Reading
* Textbook 4.1-4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4.3
* Solitaire v0.3 [PlayingStrategy.java](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire/blob/v0.3/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/solitaire/ai/PlayingStrategy.java) as a simple example of a Strategy interface;
* JetUML v1.0 [SegmentationStyle.java](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/blob/v1.0/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/jetuml/framework/SegmentationStyle.java) as a more elaborate example use of the Strategy Design Pattern.
