# Module 1 - Encapsulation

## Description

One of the major motivation for good design is to keep control of the complexity of a system. An idea that is paramount to simplifying the design of software is encapsulation. Ideally, classes serve to support functionality, but also to isolate distinct computations. This module will cover the most important concepts and techniques necessary to design well-encapsulated classes.

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

* Be able to explain the concepts of *encapsulation* and *information hiding*;
* Evaluate the quality of encapsulation realized by a single class;
* Know some of the programming language mechanisms and idioms that support encapsulation, and how to apply them;
* Understand the importance of *immutability* in software design and how to make Java classes immutable.
* Know about the concept of Design by Contract and how to apply it to Java programs using the assert statement;
* Know about *code style*, be able to explain how it contributes to code quality, and be able to apply a code-style checker and interpret its results;
* Be able to create and interpret Object Diagrams.
