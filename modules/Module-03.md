# Module 3 - Object State

## Description

The most difficult thing to reason about when looking at a program is state changes. What operations can have a side-effect, on which path can data flow, what impacts what? Is this module, I will clarify what object state is and how we can manage to keep control over its state in a principled way so we don't let the genie out of the bottle every time we instantiate an object.

## Learning Objectives

After this module you should:

* Understand the difference between a static and dynamic perspective on software;
* Understand the meaning and implications of shared state and unique objects;
* Understand the difference between the concepts of object identity and object equality, and they implications for software design;
* Be able to correctly and effectively use the methods of the Object class;
* Be able to effectively use the Singleton and Flyweight design patterns;
* Be able to effectively use UML State Diagrams to reason about the abstract states of complex stateful objects;
* Be able to correctly use Java's cloning mechanism;

## Notes

### General Concepts and Definitions


## Reading

* Textbook 2.2, 2.10, 7.1-7.4, 10.5
* Solitaire v0.3: [Card](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire/blob/v0.3/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/solitaire/cards/Card.java) as an example of the Flyweight pattern in action.
* Solitaire v0.3: [CardImages](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire/blob/v0.3/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/solitaire/cards/CardImages.java) as a different example of the Flyweight pattern in action.

## Exercises

Exercises prefixed with **(+)** are optional, more challenging questions aimed to provide you with additional design and programming experience. Exercises prefixed with **(P)** (for "project") will incrementally guide you towards the ultimate completion of a complete Solitaire application.
